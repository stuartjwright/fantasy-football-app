# Fantasy Football Application

This was my final year project for my BSc Computing degree, completed in 2020. It is a real-time fantasy football auction web application built using the MERN stack with Socket.IO.

The repository contains source code for the final application in the following folders:

* **api** - server-side code (Node.js application).
* **frontend** - client-side code (React application).

The remaining folders are:

* **data** - contains some data dumps which can be imported to MongoDB.
* **scripts** - any scripts not included in final application. Currently, there is just one Python script which was used to manipulate data from the Premier League's public API containing player data, into a form suitable for importing to MongoDB.
* **report** - contains files used to generate the final report.

The final report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/stuartjwright/fantasy-football-app/blob/master/report/report.pdf).
