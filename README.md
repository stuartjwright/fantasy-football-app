# Fantasy Football Application
## BSc Computing Final Year Project
### Completed by Stuart Wright (swrigh17@dcs.bbk.ac.uk)

The application is currently live at: <https://stuartbbk.com>

This repository contains source code for the final application in the following folders:

* **api** - server-side code (Node.js application).
* **frontend** - client-side code (React application).

The two folders above each contain their own README files with further details.

The remaining folders are:

* **data** - contains some data dumps which can be imported to MongoDB.
* **scripts** - any scripts not included in final application. Currently, there is just one Python script which was used to manipulate data from the Premier League's public API containing player data, into a form suitable for importing to MongoDB.
* **report** - contains files used to generate the final report.

Instructions for running the application are contained within the two README files in the **api** and **frontend** directories. However, there are quite a few steps involved and these may be system dependent, so please contact me if there are any issues getting the code to run and I will be able to resolve.
