# Introduction

This report documents the development of a multiplayer fantasy football game, implemented as a web application.

## Terminology

In this document, **football** means association football, or soccer as it is known in some countries.

This is common in large leagues which allow thousands or even millions of participants, where it would be unrealistic to place constraints on how many participants can have a certain player in their team. 

In smaller leagues however, it is common that each player can appear in only one fantasy team in the league. In such cases, it is necessary to
