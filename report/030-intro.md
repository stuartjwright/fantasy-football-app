## Terminology

In this document, the word **player** will always refer to a real-life football player, as opposed to a person playing this fantasy football game. The person using the application will typically be referred to as the **user**, but depending on the context they may also be referred to as a **manager** (of their fantasy football team) or a **participant** (in an auction).

Similarly, a distinction between real-life football clubs and fantasy teams is necessary. A real-life football club (e.g. Liverpool or Arsenal) will be referred to as a **club**, whereas where the word **squad** is used, it will always refer to a fantasy team. The word **team** may refer to either, but its meaning will be made clear from the context.
