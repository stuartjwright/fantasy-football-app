## Technology Stack

The MERN Stack was chosen to develop this application:

* **M**ongoDB - a NoSQL database management system.
* **E**Express - a Node.js web application framework.
* **R**eact - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **N**ode.js - a JavaScript runtime capable of executing JavaScript on a server.

In addition, the Socket.IO library was selected in order to facilitate the required real-time bi-directional communication between client and server.

Part of the motivation for choosing this stack was its popularity. There are several benefits to choosing a popular techonology stack:

* If a stack has become popular, it is likely that the technologies work well together.
* If any problems are encountered, it is likely that somebody else has encountered the same problem before.
* Libraries and documentation are likely to be regularly maintained.

That said, some further research was conducted to ensure that this was the right stack for this particular application, and the findings follow.

### React



### Socket.IO



### Node.js

The most obvious benefit to choosing Node.js for the backend is the convenience factor of writing the same language for server-side code as they use for client-side code. Switching back and forth between two or more different languages can reduce the speed of development, 

### Express



### MongoDB
