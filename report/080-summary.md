# Summary

The main aim of the project was to create a fantasy football game featuring a real-time auction, and this has been implemented to an acceptable standard such that its users would find it both practical and enjoyable. A secondary aim was to become more familiar with integrating real-time bi-directional communication in modern web applications, which was necessary in order to build this application.

## Future Development

The author enjoys playing fantasy football games, so it is likely that development will continue on this application as a hobby project. Some features which are not implemented at the time of writing are:

* A link to a third party football statistics API for data relating to real-life football events.
* Add the ability to customise the speed of the auction (the 10 second countdown timer may be too fast for new users, or too slow for experienced users).
* A mobile friendly user interface. The data-processing components of the frontend code would remain the same, but the presentational components would need to be reworked.

## Reflection

The aims of the project were successfully met, and the development process was enjoyable, despite a few frustrations along the way. The proposal was relatively ambitious considering the author had no experience building similar applications, but the scope was kept small enough such that development could realistically be completed within the time constraints.

By working with unfamiliar technologies, the author was able to learn new skills which will prove useful in development of web applications in future. The MERN stack with Socket.IO integration proved to be a good match for the requirements of this application, and led to an enjoyable development experience which was very helpful with regard to motivation.

As is evident from the composition of this report, the implementation phase of the project was by far the most time-consuming. With the benefit of hindsight, some more research should have been conducted before development started. This would likely have prevented the requirement to make such big changes to the database implementation a few weeks into development. However, this mistake did ensure that a lesson was learned and the author will be better able to design the data model correctly first time in future projects.

With the application functioning as intended, new skills developed and lessons learned along the way, the author is pleased with the results, and motivated to build more interactive web applications.
